# ri-simulation-2-julia

This is our second reinforcement learning simulation. 
We switched from Clojure Development to Julia Development.

## GUI

I build an GTK Image Framework to overlay images, a feature we need for our reinforcement learning simulation.

## Pluto

This project also contains a pluto notebook which build a good roundtrip for AI.

## TODOs

Build a clear interface from simulation to GUI interface to better integrate both.
